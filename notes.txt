- ensure SB and group descriptor metadata for flipping data block is consistent (e.g. num free data blocks)
- keep tracker of allocated blocks (so we can only deallocate those)
- keep new ioctls in a separate file ext4_evfs.c and go there for default in ioctl.c
- 


To avoid full rebuilds on Make, ensure:
- vscode autosave turned off, in case it touches a lot of files which triggers full rebuilds
- timedatectl status -> shows that it is running and syncing timestamp with host. 
    - Otherwise run: sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
