- ensure SB and group descriptor metadata for flipping data block is consistent (e.g. num free data blocks)
- keep tracker of allocated blocks (so we can only deallocate those)
- keep new ioctls in a separate file ext4_evfs.c and go there for default in ioctl.c
- 


To avoid full rebuilds on Make, ensure:
- vscode autosave turned off, in case it touches a lot of files which triggers full rebuilds
- timedatectl status -> shows that it is running and syncing timestamp with host. 
    - Otherwise run: sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd

- Update modify delete directory entries
- Should be able to take directory inode num, new file name, new subfile inode num and add as direntry for that directory inode
- Can be arbitrary name and subfile inode number for now
- Check how hardlink link+unlink work. Creating hardlinks is just adding a dirent and unlinking is removing a dirent
